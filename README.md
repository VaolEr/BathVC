# BathVC-Project
Bathroom ventilator controller project

This project created for my own pcb, based on ESP 8266 and SHT-31 humidity sensor and GUI based on Blynk app.

For communicate with SHT31-D I used Adafruit_SHT31 library downloaded into Arduino IDE.
Also I used ESP8266WiFi library and BlynkSimpleEsp8266.

It is not final version of description.
